# Playground

The playground makes it easy to compare different open-source models and iterate on system prompts by chatting with them.

Run LLMs at [https://app.lamini.ai/playground](https://app.lamini.ai/playground) or contact us at [info@lamini.ai](mailto:info@lamini.ai) to run the same UI internally at your company.
