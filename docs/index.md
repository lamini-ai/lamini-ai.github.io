# Welcome to Lamini!

Lamini is the enterprise LLM platform for building proprietary LLMs, fully owned by you. In just a few lines of code, build LLM pipelines and self-improving LLMs. Deploy within 10 minutes, and see your LLMs improve over time!

If you want to build larger models, deploy a model in production, and host it on your own infrastructure on premise or in your VPC, please contact us at [info@lamini.ai](mailto:info@lamini.ai)!

## Getting Started
```sh
pip install lamini
```
Our documentation includes detailed [Installation](get_started/install), [Inference](inference/quick_tour), [Training](training/quick_tour), and many [Example SDKs](applications/rag) to help you train your first model!

Once you're up and running, check out our [REST API](rest_api/completions) and [Python Library](lamini_python_class/__init__). 

## Web App
In addition to a REST API and Python Package, we also have a web application to help streamline model training and evalutaion. Go to [https://app.lamini.ai/](https://app.lamini.ai/) to manage your training jobs, view model eval results, test your finetuned models in a playground, generate API keys, and monitor usage.
