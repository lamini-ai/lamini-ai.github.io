Evaluation is key to understanding the performance of your LLM. We provide a few different ways to evaluate your LLM, depending on your use case.

First, you can access our [dashboard](/docs/training/dashboard.md) to see the evaluation results of your model against its base model.

Second, you can use our [evaluation API](/docs/api/evaluation.md) to evaluate your model against a dataset. If you are an Organizations Tier user, then you can also access our LLM evaluation suite.
