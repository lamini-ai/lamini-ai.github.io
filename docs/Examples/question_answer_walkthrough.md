# Question Answer Model

In this walkthrough, we'll build a working question answer model to demonstrate how one might use Lamini to gain quick insight into a specialized topic. Here, we've specialized this walkthrough to target our company blog.

## Import the QuestionAnswerModel class

Lamini provides an example harness to make interacting with the LLMEngine simpler. Import `QuestionAnswerModel` to quickly get started.

```python
from llama import QuestionAnswerModel

# Run the base model
model = QuestionAnswerModel()
```

## A pre-defined interface

`QuestionAnswerModel` uses the following input and output types internally. You won't need to re-instantiate these, this class will do the instantiation for you.

<details>
  <summary>Question and Answer Types</summary>
  
    ```python
    from llama import Type, Context

    # Input

    class Question(Type):
    question: str = Context("a question")

    # Output

    class Answer(Type):
    answer: str = Context("the response to the question")

    ```

</details>

## Add example data to the model for training

You can import data to this class by using the `load_question_answer` method, which accepts a list of python dictionaries as input. Each dictionary must have `"question"` and `"answer"` keys, and string values for each of those keys. This data is similar to "prompt" and "completion" data you may have seen before. Expand below to see this in action.

```python
data = get_example_qa_data()
# Instantiate the model and load the data into it
model = QuestionAnswerModel()
model.load_question_answer(data)
```

<details>
  <summary>Code for <code>get_example_qa_data()</code></summary>

## Train a model and evaluate the results

After you've added data, you can now train a model. Once the training is complete, you can view the eval results.
Training is done on Lamini servers and you can track the training job's progress at [https://app.lamini.ai/train](https://app.lamini.ai/train)

```python
model.train()
results = model.get_eval_results()
print(results)
```

Once a model is trained you can check the eval results to see before and after comparisons of the base model and the trained model. You can also query the new trained model like so

```python
answer = model.get_answer("How can I add data to Lamini?")
print(answer)
```
