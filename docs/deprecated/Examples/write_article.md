# Article Writer Model

In this walkthrough, you'll build an LLM that can write an article from a topic. Feel free to also run the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZsKPmXugcIJEJ3SLJ5NyJAxMkyrcF_yN).

## Define the LLM interface

Define the input and output types. Be sure to include the `Context`. This helps
the LLM understand your types in natural language.

```python
from llama import Type, Context

class Input(Type):
    topic : str = Context("what topic the article should cover")

class Output(Type):
    title : str = Context("article title starting, written in markdown, e.g. with #")
    article : str = Context("article body text, written in markdown")
```

## Import the InputOutputRunner from the llama module

```python
from llama import InputOutputRunner

model = InputOutputRunner(input_type=Input, output_type=Output)
```

The Pythia 410M-parameter model is the largest on the free-tier to train for free, and you can specify the model here:

```python
model = InputOutputRunner(input_type=Input, output_type=Output, model_name="EleutherAI/pythia-410m-v0")
```

## Add example data to the model for training

You can import data to this class by using the `save_data` method, which accepts a list of input-output pairs, formatted into your types, above.

```python
data = get_data()
model.load_data_from_paired_lists(data)
```

You can load data in many ways: Pandas DataFrame, CSV, jsonlines, or a list of input-output pairs. See the docs for [InputOutputRunner](/docs/input_output_runner.md) for all the ways.

   'article': 'Room-temperature superconductors have long been the holy grail of materials science. For decades, researchers have been working to develop materials that can exhibit superconducting properties at temperatures near or above room temperature (around 20-25Â°C). While significant progress has been made in recent years, the field has been plagued by a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the inability to control and manipulate these properties.\nHowever, recent breakthroughs have shown that it is possible to create room-temperature superconducting materials using unconventional methods. These methods involve the use of non-traditional materials and structures, such as topological insulators, and the application of novel techniques, such as strain engineering.\nOne of the most promising approaches to room-temperature superconductivity is the use of topological insulators. These materials have a non-trivial band structure that allows for the formation of Majorana fermions, which are particles that are their own antiparticles. By manipulating the properties of these materials, researchers have been'}],

   'article': 'Renewable energy costs have been steadily decreasing over the past decade, with the cost of solar and wind power dropping by as much as 70% and 50%, respectively. Despite these cost savings, big oil companies continue to lobby against renewable energy sources, using their vast resources to influence government policies and maintain their grip on the industry. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the cost of renewable energy is now lower than gas and oil in many parts of the world, yet big oil companies are still able to maintain their dominance. This is a clear example of how special interests are able to manipulate the political process to maintain their power and profits, even when it goes against the public interest.'}],
