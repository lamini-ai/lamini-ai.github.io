            "output": "Lamini is capable of automatically handling hyperparameter tuning during the model customization process. It employs an intelligent algorithm to explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimal combination of values. This is done through techniques such as heuristics, grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or genetic algorithms. Lamini efficiently utilizes computational resources to evaluate multiple model instances with different hyperparameter configurations. It incorporates techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization. By automating hyperparameter tuning, Lamini streamlines the machine learning workflow and improves the chances of developing high-performing models for specific use cases.",

It is designed to be easily accessible and user-friendly.  The LLM Engine itself requires GPU accelerated servers capable of running large language models.  Lamini hosts such machines that can be easily connected to, e.g. from a jupyter notebook or python program.  Lamini also offers enterprise deployments of the LLM Engine on your infrastructure.",
