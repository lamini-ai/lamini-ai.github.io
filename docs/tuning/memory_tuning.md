# Memory Tuning

Memory Tuning is a revolutionary new capability from Lamini that lets you embed precise, factual data inside the LLMâ€™s memory by tuning the LLM with millions of adapters. Memory Tuning turns any open LLM, such as Llama 3 or Mistral 3, into a Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) that can recall your facts with photographic memory by selectively routing across its experts. With a MoME, frequent hallucinations become a thing of the past.

Memory tuning allows your LLMs to both keep their general reasoning capabilities and commit specific factual data to their weights as memory.
