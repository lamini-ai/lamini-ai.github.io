Your tuning dashboard makes it easy to see all your tuning jobs (finetuning, LoRAs, pretraining, etc.) at [https://app.lamini.ai/tune](https://app.lamini.ai/train).

You can easily access a playground for all your models and be able to share this view with your colleagues and friends. You can also view the logs to see what happened during tuning, and see the evaluation results of your model against its base model.

Finally, you can also view the status of your tuning jobs.
