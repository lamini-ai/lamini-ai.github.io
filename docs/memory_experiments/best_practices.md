## Defining Your Use Case
Before beginning any memory tuning work, clearly articulate what you want the model to do by addressing these key areas:

### Task Definition
- What specific task or problem will the model solve?
    * Example: "Classify customer support tickets by urgency" or "Generate product descriptions from specifications"

**Example Use Case: Legal Document Analysis**

### Success Metrics
- How will success be measured?
    * Example: "95% classification accuracy on test set" or "Average response time under 2 seconds"
  - Define clear metrics (accuracy, response time, user satisfaction, etc.)
    * Example: "F1 score for urgency classification" or "ROUGE scores for summary quality"
  - Set target performance levels
    * Example: "Minimum 90% accuracy across all categories" or "Maximum 5% false urgents"
  - Plan how to validate results
    * Example: "Weekly manual review of 100 random predictions" or "A/B testing with current process"

### Business Impact
- How will this improve existing processes?
    * Example: "Reduce ticket routing time by 75%" or "Eliminate manual classification backlog"
- What new opportunities will it create?
    * Example: "24/7 automated ticket prioritization" or "Real-time urgency alerting system"
- What are the expected cost savings or revenue increases?
    * Example: "Reduce support staff overtime by 30%" or "Increase customer satisfaction by 25%"

### Constraints and Requirements
- Budget limitations
    * Example: "Maximum compute cost of $1000/month" or "One-time training budget of $5000"
- Technical infrastructure requirements
    * Example: "Must run on existing cloud infrastructure" or "Maximum latency of 100ms"
- Data privacy and security considerations
    * Example: "No PII storage" or "HIPAA compliance required"
- Response time requirements
    * Example: "Classification within 5 seconds" or "Batch processing within 1 hour"
- Accuracy thresholds
    * Example: "99.9% accuracy for high-urgency tickets" or "Maximum 1% false positives"

### Stakeholder Analysis
- Who will use the model?
    * Example: "Front-line support staff" or "Customer service managers"
- Who will maintain it?
    * Example: "ML Operations team" or "Support engineering group"
- Who needs to approve it?
    * Example: "Security compliance team" or "Customer support director"
- Who will be impacted by it?
    * Example: "Customer support representatives" or "End customers waiting for responses"

## Finding Relevant Data
Gather examples that represent your intended use case. Look for existing data if enhancing current processes, or create new data for novel applications.

### Example Scenario: Customer Support Ticket Classification

For existing processes:
- Collect historical tickets with manual urgency classifications
- Include resolution times and outcomes
- Analyze existing classification patterns

For new opportunities:
- Create synthetic examples with sample support tickets
- Engage support staff to label historical data
- Research public datasets from similar industries

## Starting Memory Experiments

### Manual Task Analysis
Begin by performing the task yourself to understand the process thoroughly. 

Document:
- Your step-by-step approach
- Required information sources
- Reasoning methodology

### Evaluation Framework
Develop a robust evaluation strategy combining:

Qualitative Metrics:
- Response quality
- User satisfaction

Quantifiable Components:
- Factual correctness
- Source alignment

Note: Always validate metric correlations with stakeholders.

### Risk Assessment
Consider potential failure points:
- Input variations that could cause confusion
  - Edge cases and corner cases
  - Ambiguous scenarios requiring judgment
  - Common error patterns
  - Security and safety considerations

### Complexity Analysis
Evaluate task difficulty across multiple dimensions:
- Required domain knowledge
- Process complexity
- Context dependencies
- Information freshness requirements
- Reasoning depth

### Task Dimensioning
Break down the task into measurable components:

Input Complexity:
- Length and format variations
- Information quality and completeness
- Input source diversity

Processing Requirements:
- Required reasoning steps
- Decision dependencies
- External knowledge needs

Output Specifications:
- Format requirements
- Consistency needs
- Validation criteria

These components provide a framework for automated metric tracking and evaluation.
